AbhayaPower Installaion
-----------------------

To install everything you first need perl 5.8 or higher with these
modules installed:
	Device::SerialPort
	Device::ParallelPort
	Device::ParallelPort::drv::parport

Everything else should be already included...	

You also need a webserver (developed using apache2) that can run cgi scripts
and cron (which should be on any unix like system).

-----------------------

When you uncompressed this archive you should have found it included these:
	INSTALL		-This install reference file
	bin		-Directory with scripts for data gathering and usage
	etc		-Directory with a configuration file
	htdocs		-Directory with documents to be served by a web server
	log		-Directory with the data logs from the OutBack Mate
	module		-Directory with local perl modules

You can start by putting the file "etc/abhayapower" in the system's "/etc"
directory as this is where all the other scripts expect to find it.

Everything else can go in /opt/abhayapower/ (or anywhere else if you change the
configuration file '/etc/abhayapower' you just moved in the last step)

The following layout is the default setup:

/etc/abhayapower
/opt/abhayapower/bin/
/opt/abhayapower/htdocs/
/opt/abhayapower/log/
/opt/abhayapower/module/

-----------------------------

Add a new user with the name "abhayapower" and set the user's home folder
to "/opt/abhayapower". and run the command

	chmod -r abhayapower:abhayapower /opt/abhayapower

as superuser (root).  Then add the user abhayapower to the group that owns 
the /dev/ttyS and /dev/ttyUSB devices (on ubuntu 10.8 this is the dialout group)
and the group that owns /dev/lp devices (lp on ubuntu)

-----------------------------

To setup the timed scripts for data gathering the following entries should be
added to crontab by typing "crontab -e" as the user abhayapower

* * * * * /opt/abhayapower/bin/minutely-tasks.pl &> /dev/null
0 * * * * /opt/abhayapower/bin/hourly-tasks.pl &> /dev/null

This sets the mate-logger.pl script to collect data from the OutBack Mate every
minute and for the hourly data to be calculated at the start of every hour.

-----------------------------

To start the daemon that turns the Parallel Port pins on and off for the LEDs to
display the current status you need to run the status-daemon.pl script.  To have
it run at startup put the following in a startup script (/etc/rc.local for
example):

/usr/bin/perl /opt/abhayapower/bin/status-calc.pl &
/usr/bin/perl /opt/abhayapower/bin/status-daemon.pl &

-----------------------------

Lastly, to setup the server to serve the AbhayPower frontend:

Edit the included file "etc/apache2/sites-available/abhayapower" to point
to the directory you are storing the htdocs directory for this frontend

copy the file into /etc/apache2/sites-available:
sudo cp etc/apache2/sites-available/abhayapower /etc/apache2/sites-available/

make a symbolic link to the file into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-avaiable/abhayapower /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/010-abhayapower

run 'apache2ctl restart' and things should be up and running...
